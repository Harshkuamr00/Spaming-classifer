# Spaming Detect 

## Project Overview
This project is a **Spam Email/SMS Classifier** implemented in Python using machine learning techniques. The classifier is designed to identify whether a given text message (email or SMS) is spam or not spam (ham). The primary algorithm used leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques for text preprocessing and classification models like Naive Bayes.
## Datasets
The dataset used contains labeled messages categorized as spam or ham. The data is typically represented in a tabular format with two columns:
- Label (spam or ham)
- Message content text
## Features

- Data loading and preprocessing including cleaning, tokenization, and vectorization.
- Text feature extraction using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).
- Spam classification using machine learning (Naive Bayes or similar classifiers).
- Evaluation of model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Jupyter Notebook based interactive environment for ease of experimentation and visualization.

## Project Structure
- `SpamClassifier.ipynb` - Main Jupyter notebook that implements the entire workflow: data loading, preprocessing, training, and evaluation.
- Other Python scripts for modular code (if any) implementing preprocessing, vectorization, and model logic.
- `requirements.txt` (if provided) - Lists the Python packages needed to run the project.
## Installation Package
- pandas
- numpy
- regrex
- joblib
- sklearn
- streamlit

## Result
The spam classifier achieves good accuracy on the test set, effectively distinguishing spam from ham messages.
## Future Work
- Experiment with other classification algorithms such as SVM, Random Forest, or deep learning models.
- Improve preprocessing by handling emojis, URLs, and special characters.
- Deploy the model as a web API for real-time spam detection.
- Incorporate adaptive learning to update the model with new spam trends.
